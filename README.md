A modern interface to the BBC Sounds radio catalogue.

## Usage

A `ChannelSchedule` stores a single day's listings, for a single channel.

- National, local, regional channels can be selected by ID or short name
- The schedule with today's date is loaded by default

To load today's schedule for BBC R4:

```py
from beeb.nav import ChannelSchedule
ChannelSchedule.from_channel_name("r4")
```
⇣
```
ChannelSchedule for BBC Radio 4 on 2021-03-17
```

These ChannelSchedule objects can be used to find programmes:

```py
>>> from beeb.nav import ChannelSchedule
>>> s = ChannelSchedule.from_channel_name("r4")
>>> s.get_broadcast_by_title("Today", pid_only=True)
'm000t476'
>>> s.get_broadcast_by_title("Midnight News")
00:00 on 17/03/2021 — Midnight News
>>> for b in s.get_broadcast_by_title("Shipping Forecast", multi=True): b
00:48 on 17/03/2021 — Shipping Forecast
05:20 on 17/03/2021 — Shipping Forecast
12:03 on 17/03/2021 — Shipping Forecast
```

</details>

As well as schedules for a single day, _beeb_ has `ChannelListings`, a collection of `ChannelSchedule` objects over a
given time period (from up to 30 days ago).

```py
>>> from beeb.nav import ChannelListings
>>> ChannelListings.from_channel_name("r4")
ChannelListings for BBC Radio 4 from 2021-02-17 to 2021-03-18 (30 days)
```

The schedules are stored as a chronological list in the `ChannelListings.schedules` attribute

```py
>>> from beeb.nav import ChannelListings
>>> l = ChannelListings.from_channel_name("r4")
ChannelListings for BBC Radio 4 from 2021-02-17 to 2021-03-18 (30 days)
>>> l.schedules[0]
ChannelSchedule for BBC Radio 4 on 2021-02-17
```

ChannelListings follows the same interface as ChannelSchedule (they share a commonly bound method,
to avoid too much parameter passing).
